                                <p></p>In groups of 7 we were given an assignment to create any system we want,we came with
                
                                AUTO TAXI is a taxi industry-based software system which provides help to taxi passengers to find a 
                                taxi in a respective taxi rank to their destination. The software consists of registered routes which 
                                taxis uses from one rank to another to their end destination, therefore on its duty of commuting 
                                passengers, at first a user of the AUTO TAXI will gain access by logging in then navigate through the 
                                system according to the taxi rank she/he is in and find all the information about the taxis operations, 
                                and she will find all places that the taxis in that taxi rank transport passengers, and she/he will 
                                choose where he/she is heading. Then passengers will indicate his/her spot of being dropped off 
                                through the street’s names or any recognizable location through the AUTO TAXI software in line with 
                                the route of a taxi.</p>

                <h1>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h1>
                <p></p>The current situation is that when people want to go somewhere they need transport, most people use taxis. The issue is normally overload, change when people have paid and time waisted when the driver takes different routes searching for other people. 
                Each request made with a smart device leads to an early transport, correct route at the right time and no payment issues.</p> 
                
                
                <h1>OBECTIVE USERS OF THE SYSTEM 
                
                
                IFindTaxi System is a project is aimed at assisting passengers with finding taxi ranks and taxis to their respective desired destination. With just the click of finger any individual can access the software before they can travel to find the nearest taxi rank to wherever they want to go, prices are even displayed in respective of where one want to travel to. Firstly, a passenger will through the software in a taxi rank search to wherever they want to go after finding the nearest taxi rank to an extent of finding where the taxi is located inside the taxi rank line, and they can even pay through the software. It includes taxi drivers too as they play a role of registering their taxi credentials in the system and activating a taxi when it is their turn to commute passengers, so that a passenger can see an active taxi inside the IFindTaxi software as explained above. The primary objective of is for a IFindTaxi passenger to identify the spot of their destination where they want to be dropped off in line with a registered route taxis uses regularly, because in most cases people struggle with drop off spot due to communication misunderstandings of a taxi driver and a passenger.
